# SwiftUI.AlbumImporter

iOS developers need to deal with images from time to time. During development, we usually use the images in the Photo Library of the Simulator to test our apps. This app can be used to import images to the Photo Library of the Simulator.

Before running this app, you need to place your images in the Images.bundle file. The app will fetch images files from there.
